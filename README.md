# AR SHOP

The emergence of virtual reality and augmented reality is constantly providing new ways of interaction with digital information.However, virtual reality indulges the users in simulated world or artificial world with very little to no connection with the real world.Augmented reality adds or integrates virtual objects to real ones. It refers to computer technology that adds information to a user’s sensory perceptions. AR research majorly focuses on see-through devices, such as electronic head gears,cell phones.It projects graphics over the world environment in real time.This interface minimizes the effort that a user has to put when switching his/her attention between real tasks and a computer screen. In AR, the user’s point of view and the computer interface get integrated together. 

The AR shop is an interactive shop where users can see the live demonstration of the object that they wish to purchase,choosing amongst a number of different kinds of objects by looking through their phone, enabling easier accessibility and a better understandability of the actual worth of the object that the user wishes to purchase.
